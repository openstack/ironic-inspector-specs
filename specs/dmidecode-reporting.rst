==================================================================
Reporting Processor, Memory, and BIOS dmidecode Introspection Data
==================================================================

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic-python-agent/+bug/1635057

As of today, node introspection data provides information related to CPU,
memory, and BIOS. However, a few more key data fields are important to help
deployers select nodes matching specific criteria to facilitate smart
scheduling. Currently, total and physical memory size are collected.
However, more specific information about DIMMs would help deployers to
schedule nodes for low latency workloads. Similarly, CPU data fields such as
signature and socket designation would be useful for inventory management.
This spec proposes a collector for the **ironic-inspector** to obtain a few
more key details of CPU, memory, and BIOS.


Problem description
===================

Configuring nodes for better performance is a priority from the operatorâ€™s
point of view. The operator can specify node capabilities in a nova flavor
for a node to be selected for `scheduling`_. Collecting key CPU, memory, and
BIOS data fields will enable operator to create flavors based on discovered
hardware features.

Here is a list of the key data fields that will be of use for this purpose:

* ``BIOS Version``: To know which firmware version is running on the host, for
  maintenance reasons.
* ``Socket Designation``: To know which CPU is seated in which socket, useful
  for inventory management.
* ``Signature``: To know which CPU features are available.
* ``Max Speed``: To know single thread performance.
* ``Core Count``, ``Core Enabled``, ``Thread Count``: To know about
  hyperthreading, for smart scheduling.
* ``Number Of Memory Devices``: This is needed for low latency workloads, to
  ensure lowest possible latency environment for an application (for the nova
  scheduler to select a node matching specific criteria).
* ``Memory Device Size``: Same as above.
* ``Memory Device Speed``: Same as above.


Proposed change
===============

The proposed change is to implement a collector for listing the details of the
processor, memory, and BIOS in the **ironic-python-agent**'s inspector module
using the `dmidecode utility`_ and then returning the collected data to the
**ironic-inspector**. The processing done on this data in the
**ironic-python-agent** is limited, to allow for the server side plugin to
process as much or as little of the data as needed.

.. note::

   The ``dmidecode`` utility reports information about a system's hardware as
   described in its system BIOS according to the `SMBIOS/DMI standard`_ (see a
   `sample output`_). This information includes system manufacturer, model
   name, serial number, BIOS version and other details such as usage status of
   CPU sockets and memory module slots. The ``dmidecode`` output is
   vendor-dependent and the fields are optional. The deployer should be aware
   of this when using the data.


The format of the data collected by the new collector in
**ironic-python-agent** looks like this::
